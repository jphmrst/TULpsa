\def\copyrightA{In 1998, America's copyright laws were amended to
  regulate Internet radio streaming.  Unfortunately, the new law does
  not differentiate between commercial, for-profit radio streaming,
  and streaming by non-profit radio stations like WTUL.  Unless
  Congress acts to correct this imbalance, non-commercial streaming
  broadcasts will be expensive to broadcast and burdensome to manage.
  Many small and independent broadcasters have already been forced
  from the airwaves.  Please visit WTUL's MySpace page, \textsl{www

\def\copyrightB{Recent laws governing copyright and the Internet have
