## WTUL announcement rosters generator

### Prerequisites

The roster generator relies on three other programs.  Doing anything
with this code requires these two:

 - Scala build tool (SBT, [homepage](https://www.scala-sbt.org/))

 - LaTeX document system
   ([downloads page](https://www.latex-project.org/get/))

Additionally, if you wish to automatically push generated rosters out
to some other server, you will need `rsync`:

 - RSYNC file transfer tool ([homepage](https://rsync.samba.org/))
