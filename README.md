## WTUL announcement rosters generator

### Prerequisites

The roster generator relies on three other programs.  Doing anything
with this code requires these two:

 - Scala build tool (SBT, [[https://www.scala-sbt.org/][homepage]])

 - LaTeX document system
   ([[https://www.latex-project.org/get/][downloads page]])

Additionally, if you wish to automatically push generated rosters out
to some other server, you will need `rsync`:

 - RSYNC file transfer tool ([[https://rsync.samba.org/][homepage]])
